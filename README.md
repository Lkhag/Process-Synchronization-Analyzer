# Process-Synchronization-Analyzer
real-time Process Synchronization Analyzer

@Overview
The process synchronization analyst is a GUI-based application designed to simulate, monitor and analyze the behaviour of multiple procedures that run at the same time in a system. This process provides insight into synchronization, resource use and system performance, making it a valuable tool for understanding operating system concepts, troubleshoot process management process and evaluate the system's efficiency.

@Key Components
Evaluation process performance: Create and manage several activist procedures with configured speed and preferences.
Monitor System Resources: Track CPU, memory, disc and network use in real time.
Analyze synchronization: Inspection how processes should start, master and finish.
Imagine performance: Show process position and system matrix in a spontaneous graphic interface.
Log event: Keep a wide log of process activities and system changes for troubleshooting and analysis.

@System Architecture:
The project follows a multi-layered architecture:

1. Backend (Process Management & Monitoring)
•	Multiprocessing: Uses Python’s multiprocessing module to create and manage independent worker processes.
•	Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
  o	Queues (multiprocessing.Queue) for status and progress updates.
  o	Events (multiprocessing.Event) for pause/resume and termination signals.
•	System Monitoring: Uses “psutil” to collect CPU, memory, disk, and network stats.

2. Frontend (GUI & Visualization)
•	PyQt6 Framework: Provides a responsive and interactive user interface.
•	Dynamic Process Table: Displays process IDs, statuses (Running/Paused/Terminated), progress bars, and execution times.
•	Real-Time Graphs: Uses Matplotlib to plot CPU and memory usage trends.
•	Event Log: A scrollable log panel that records process activities and system events.

3. Synchronization & Control
•	Process Pausing/Resuming: Uses Event flags to halt and resume execution.
•	Graceful Termination: Ensures processes shut down correctly without resource leaks.
•	Priority Management: Adjusts process priorities based on OS (Windows/Linux).
